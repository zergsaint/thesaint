Summary: Backups and how to do it

  Improve your backups and save the day

  I have been doing some research into how to make virtual full backups with bacula. This has been a bit challenging since I am creating an virtual server to use as lab for bacula storage.
  So after the initial configuration I will try to make the container run its mysql from the SSD drives from the storage node.

  In this article I will present how the work progressed and what issues i encountered. So the basics is simple, after the installation of the OpenVZ server I had to make some custom settings for the container itself.
  And after that it was the basic install of bacula, the only thing I changed is the running scheme (will get back to that later). So first before anything the directorie /var/lib/mysql should have its physical storage on the SSD drives.

  This is due to the performance enhancement it will give the database further on in the project.
  
  So on the storage node I created `/etc/vz/conf/{vzid}.mount`
  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash

  . /etc/vz/vz.conf
  . ${VE_CONFFILE}
  SRC=/vz-ssd-data/{vzid}/
  DST=/var/lib/mysql
  if [ ! -e ${VE_ROOT}${DST} ]; then mkdir -p ${VE_ROOT}${DST}; fi
  mount -n -t simfs ${SRC} ${VE_ROOT}${DST} -o ${SRC}

  </code></pre>


  Once this script has been save a restart of the container is needed to remount the directory on the other harddrives.

  The installation and configuration of bacula can be a bit tricky. There are different files/demons that are depending on eachother and several passwords to handle. So to grasp the greater picture is not allways easy.

  `source www.bacula.com`
  
  The picture above is a great guideline in how to get your bacula configuration up and running in no time. So now the basic work is done and the LAB can begin.

  So the plan is to have a fullbackup once every month, then run virtualfull backups once every week, and inbetween these it will be the incremental jobs. The data will be saved for 30 days since I dont want to save outdated data.
  So why would i want to run a virtualfull backup instead of the normal full? well it is due to the amount of data that is going to be backed up. If it was a couple of large files it would do, but if you backup several thousands small files it will take a small eternity for the job to finish.
