  Better safe than sorry

  Ok so what is this magic nmap? Well in short terms it is a program written to scan for open ports and services on hosts within a network. And the long story you can read somewhere else.
  

  So Why would I use it? Well thats up to you, but it can be extremly helpful to see what doors you forgot to lock on your server. Lets think of it like an house.

  
  Locked doors is a precaution from your side to make it difficult for burgulars. It is the same for servers, the less ports / services they can exploit the safer you will be.
