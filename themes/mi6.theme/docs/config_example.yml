# You should really specify your content's author when generating an
# Atom feed. Specify at least one of name, uri or email, and Nesta will
# include it in your feed. See the Atom spec for more info:

author:
  name: Your name
  uri: http://example.com
  email: personal@email.com

# You can stick with the default look and feel, or use a theme. Themes are
# easy to create or install, and live inside the themes directory. You
# can also use scripts/theme to install them.
#
theme: mi6.theme

# If you want to use the Disqus service (http://disqus.com) to display
# comments on your site, register a Disqus account and then specify your
# site's short name here. A comment form will automatically be added to
# the bottom of your pages.
#
#disqus_short_name: your_username

# cache
#     Set it to true if you'd like Nesta to cache your pages in ./public.
#     Useful if you're deploying Nesta with a proxy server such as Nginx,
#     but not in the least bit helpful if your pages are dynamic, or you're
#     deploying Nesta to Heroku.
#
cache: false

# content
#     The root directory where nesta will look for your article files.
#     Should contain "pages" and "attachments" subdirectories that contain
#     your actual content and the (optional) menu.txt file that links to your
#     main category pages.
#
content: content

# google_analytics_code
#     Set this if you want Google Analytics to track traffic on your site.
#     Probably best not to set a default value, but to set it in production.
#
#     The production settings are used if you're deploying to Heroku, so
#     scroll down a bit to set it in production even if you're not deploying
#     to your own server.
#
# google_analytics_code: "UA-???????-?"

# Overriding "cache" and "content" in production is recommended if you're
# deploying Nesta to your own server (but see the deployment documentation
# on the Nesta site). Setting google_analytics_code in production is
# recommended regardless of how you're deploying (if you have a GA account!).
#
# Don't forget to uncomment the "production:" line too...

# production:
#   cache: true
#   content: /var/apps/nesta/shared/content
#   google_analytics_code: "UA-???????-?"

# Mailer
#   Pony mailer settings
#   Default set to gmail settings
#   You will need to update at least:
#   to, user_name, pw

mailer:
  subject: "Site contact form: "
  to: "personal@email.com"
  via: smtp
  via_options:
    address: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    authentication: plain
    enable_starttls_auto: true
    pw: "very secure password"
    user_name: "mailer"
